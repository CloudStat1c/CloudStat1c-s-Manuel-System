[EVERY THING LISTED IS MAYBE NOT TRUE!]

FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S 3

WELCOME, NIGHT GUARD!
You’ve taken a job at Fazbear’s Fright: the horror attraction based on the old Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. Your task is to survive the night while monitoring the animatronics and maintaining the building’s systems.

────────────────────────────
1. GAME OBJECTIVE
────────────────────────────
- Survive from 12 AM to 6 AM.
- Monitor cameras, audio, and ventilation systems.
- Prevent animatronic attacks while managing limited system resources.

────────────────────────────
2. OFFICE EQUIPMENT & SYSTEMS
────────────────────────────
🎥 Security Cameras:
- Track Springtrap and phantom animatronics through all rooms.
- Phantom animatronics cannot physically harm you but will disrupt systems.

📡 Audio Devices:
- Play audio in specific rooms to lure Springtrap away from the office.
- Misuse can increase risk; play audio carefully and strategically.

⚡ Ventilation System:
- Maintain air pressure in the office vents.
- Phantom animatronics and system failures reduce ventilation efficiency.
- If ventilation fails, hallucinations increase and can cause game over.

────────────────────────────
3. ANIMATRONIC GUIDE
────────────────────────────
- **Springtrap**: The only real threat. Stalks the building and can reach your office if you fail to manage audio.  
- **Phantom Animatronics**: Hallucinations of old animatronics. Cannot kill you but disrupt systems.  

💡 Tips:
- Focus on Springtrap first; phantom distractions can be ignored unless they cause system failures.
- Play audio in the correct room on time to lure Springtrap back.
- Avoid looking directly at phantoms for too long.

────────────────────────────
4. SYSTEM MANAGEMENT
────────────────────────────
- **Power** is replaced by **system maintenance**.
- Systems (camera, audio, ventilation) can fail if overused.
- Keep a balance: don’t overuse cameras, audio, or vent fixes.
- Watch the status lights; they indicate which system needs attention.

────────────────────────────
5. NIGHT-BY-NIGHT ADVICE
────────────────────────────
Night 1-2:
- Learn Springtrap’s patterns. Phantoms begin appearing.

Night 3-4:
- Phantom animatronics appear more frequently.
- Audio cues become critical for Springtrap.

Night 5-6 (Extra Night):
- Maximum difficulty. Multi-tasking is crucial: audio + camera + ventilation.
- Stay calm; mistakes are fatal.

────────────────────────────
6. FINAL NOTES
────────────────────────────
- Focus on Springtrap; phantoms are distractions.
- Maintain office systems consistently.
- Patience, observation, and timing are your keys to survival.

GOOD LUCK, NIGHT GUARD!
