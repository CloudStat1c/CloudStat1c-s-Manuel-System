[EVERY THING LISTED IS MAYBE NOT TRUE!]

FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S 4

WELCOME!
You are now inside a child’s bedroom haunted by nightmares of Freddy Fazbear and his friends. Survive each night from 12 AM to 6 AM, listening carefully and reacting to the animatronic threats.

────────────────────────────
1. GAME OBJECTIVE
────────────────────────────
- Survive the night in the bedroom.
- Listen carefully for audio cues to detect animatronic movement.
- Close doors and check the closet or hallway when necessary.

────────────────────────────
2. OFFICE EQUIPMENT
────────────────────────────
🚪 Bedroom Doors:
- Close doors when you hear animatronics near the room.
- Do not keep doors closed unnecessarily — it can exhaust your attention.

🔦 Flashlight:
- Use to check the hallway and closet.
- Only flash when you hear audio cues, or animatronics may sneak in.

3. ANIMATRONIC GUIDE
────────────────────────────
- **Nightmare Freddy**: Moves along the bed; watch for audio cues.  
- **Nightmare Bonnie**: Moves through the hallway; flash your light when you hear him.  
- **Nightmare Chica**: Moves through the right hallway; use flashlight carefully.  
- **Nightmare Foxy**: Moves fast; listen for his footsteps.  
- **Nightmare Fredbear**: Appears late in the night; can instantly kill if not monitored.  
- **Nightmare (Other)**: Shadows and minor animatronics appear occasionally; focus on main threats.

💡 Tips:
- Close doors only when you hear an animatronic nearby.  
- Audio cues are everything; do not rely on visuals alone.  
- Flash the hallway quickly; long flashes will allow animatronics to approach.  
- Stay calm; panic leads to mistakes.

4. NIGHT-BY-NIGHT ADVICE
────────────────────────────
Night 1-2:
- Get used to sound cues and basic animatronic behavior.

Night 3-4:
- Animatronics become more aggressive. Start reacting quickly to audio cues.

Night 5-6 (Extra Night):
- Maximum difficulty. Animatronics move faster and audio cues overlap.
- Focus on sound and timing for doors and flashlight.

5. FINAL NOTES
