FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S 2 - OFFICIAL NIGHT GUARD HANDBOOK

WELCOME, NIGHT GUARD!
Congratulations on your new job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza! Your task is to survive the night from 12 AM to 6 AM while monitoring the animatronics. This handbook will guide you through every tool, animatronic, and strategy you need to survive all five nights… and beyond.

────────────────────────────
1. GAME OBJECTIVE
────────────────────────────
- Survive each night without being caught by animatronics.
- Monitor all rooms and halls using the security cameras.
- Conserve your office equipment: flashlight, mask, and music box.
- Remember: observation + patience = survival.

────────────────────────────
2. OFFICE EQUIPMENT & TOOLS
────────────────────────────
⚡ Flashlight:
- Use to check hallways and vents.
- Conserves power compared to closing doors in FNAF 1.
- Essential for detecting Foxy in the hallway.

🦊 Freddy Mask:
- Wear the mask when an animatronic enters your office.
- Fool the animatronics into thinking you are one of them.
- Works on Withereds, Toy Animatronics, and some others.

🎵 Music Box:
- Located in Prize Corner; rewind it regularly.
- If the music box winds down completely, the Puppet attacks and game over occurs.

🎥 Security Cameras:
- Monitor all rooms to track animatronic movements.
- Keep an eye on key areas: hallways, vents, Prize Corner.
- Avoid lingering too long on cameras — some animatronics move faster if watched.

3. ANIMATRONIC GUIDE
────────────────────────────

TOY ANIMATRONICS
----------------
- **Toy Freddy**: Slowly approaches your office; use mask if he enters.
- **Toy Bonnie**: Left hallway; flash lights and use mask when needed.
- **Toy Chica**: Right hallway; flash lights and use mask when needed.
- **Mangle**: Right vent; frequent flashlight checks prevent its advance.
- **Balloon Boy (BB)**: Left vent; disables your flashlight if he enters office.
- **The Puppet**: Must keep music box wound; neglecting it causes immediate game over.

WITHERED ANIMATRONICS
----------------------
- **Withered Freddy**: Moves slowly; mask prevents attack if he enters office.
- **Withered Bonnie**: Approaches from left side; watch left hallway closely.
- **Withered Chica**: Approaches from right; watch right hallway.
- **Withered Foxy**: Hides in Pirate Cove; check cameras often to prevent sudden sprint.
- **Withered Golden Freddy**: Rare, unpredictable; appears in office. Avoid staring at him too long; crash may occur. Use mask to survive.

GENERAL NOTES:
- Each animatronic has unique audio cues; listen carefully.
- Withereds are more aggressive at later nights.
- Multi-tasking is key: music box + mask + cameras + flashlight.

4. SURVIVAL STRATEGY
────────────────────────────
💡 **Tip:** Flash hallways quickly; don’t waste flashlight on empty rooms.  
⚠️ **Warning:** Balloon Boy disables your flashlight; watch vents constantly.  
💡 **Tip:** Keep music box wound at all times to prevent Puppet attack.  
⚠️ **Warning:** Withered Foxy sprints if ignored; frequent camera checks required.  
💡 **Tip:** Use Freddy mask when animatronics enter office; most Withereds and Toys will be fooled.

Power Management:
- Power drains slowly but is limited.
- Mask usage and flashlight drain minimal power; prioritize survival tools.
- Overuse of flashlight may speed up animatronic activity.
