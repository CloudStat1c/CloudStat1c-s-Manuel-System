FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S

Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza! Your goal is to survive each night from 12 AM to 6 AM while avoiding the animatronics. Follow this guide to play effectively.

1. GAME OBJECTIVE
- Survive all five nights as the night security guard.
- Avoid being caught by Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, or Foxy.
- Manage your office resources carefully: power is limited.

2. SECURITY CAMERAS
- Access cameras by pressing the CAMERA button.
- Watch the hallways and rooms to track animatronic movements.
- Focus on key areas:
  * Left Hall → Bonnie’s route
  * Right Hall → Chica’s route
  * Pirate Cove → Foxy hides here
  * Stage → Freddy stays mostly here

3. DOORS AND LIGHTS
- Each office door and light uses power when activated.
- Only close doors if an animatronic is at the doorway.
- Flash your hallway light to check for intruders without wasting too much power.

4. ANIMATRONIC BEHAVIORS
- Freddy: Moves slowly but can appear suddenly in your office late at night.
- Bonnie: Approaches from the left; watch the left hall.
- Chica: Approaches from the right; watch the right hall.
- Foxy: Stays in Pirate Cove; monitor cameras frequently to prevent a sprint to your office.

5. POWER MANAGEMENT
- Power is finite each night.
- Keep doors open and lights off whenever safe.
- Use cameras sparingly — overusing them accelerates animatronic activity.
- Run out of power → doors and lights stop working → animatronics can enter freely.

6. TIPS & STRATEGY
- Check cameras quickly, don’t linger too long.
- Listen to audio cues: footsteps, laughter, or door knocks.
- Track Foxy often to prevent sudden attacks.
- Stay calm; panic leads to mistakes and early game over.
- Remember: observation + patience = survival.

7. WINNING
- Survive from 12 AM to 6 AM for all five nights.
- Some nights introduce new animatronic behavior; adapt your strategy.
- Good luck, night guard!
