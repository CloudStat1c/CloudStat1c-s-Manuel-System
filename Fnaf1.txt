FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S

WELCOME, NIGHT GUARD!
You’ve taken the night shift at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. Your goal is to survive each night from 12 AM to 6 AM while avoiding the animatronics. This handbook will guide you through all tools, animatronic behavior, and survival strategies.

────────────────────────────
1. GAME OBJECTIVE
────────────────────────────
- Survive from 12 AM to 6 AM without being caught by animatronics.
- Monitor security cameras to track movement.
- Conserve office power: lights and doors drain energy.
- Observation and patience are key to survival.

────────────────────────────
2. OFFICE EQUIPMENT
────────────────────────────
💡 Flashlights / Hall Lights:
- Used to check hallways and doorways.
- Conserves power compared to leaving doors closed all night.

🚪 Doors:
- Close only when an animatronic is at the doorway.
- Keep doors open otherwise to conserve power.

🎥 Security Cameras:
- Monitor rooms and hallways to track animatronic movement.
- Do not stay on cameras too long — it may accelerate animatronic activity.

────────────────────────────
3. ANIMATRONIC GUIDE
────────────────────────────
- **Freddy Fazbear**: Stays mostly on stage; moves slowly. Approaches your office at night.  
- **Bonnie the Bunny**: Moves from the left hallway. Flash lights and close the door when necessary.  
- **Chica the Chicken**: Moves from the right hallway. Watch carefully and close the door if needed.  
- **Foxy the Pirate Fox**: Hides in Pirate Cove; check cameras frequently to prevent sudden sprints.  

💡 Tips:
- Listen for audio cues: footsteps, laughter, door knocks.  
- Do not panic; staying calm helps you survive.  

────────────────────────────
4. POWER MANAGEMENT
────────────────────────────
- Power is limited each night. Doors and lights drain it.
- Overusing doors or lights will leave you powerless before 6 AM.
- If power runs out, animatronics can enter freely — game over.

────────────────────────────
5. SURVIVAL STRATEGY
────────────────────────────
⚡ Tip: Flash hallway lights quickly instead of keeping doors closed constantly.  
⚡ Tip: Watch cameras sparingly; only track animatronics that are active.  
⚡ Tip: Conserve power early in the night to ensure it lasts until 6 AM.  
⚡ Tip: Focus on Foxy — he moves fastest and can end your night abruptly.  

────────────────────────────
6. NIGHT-BY-NIGHT ADVICE
────────────────────────────
Night 1:
- Learn animatronic patterns. Mostly observation; little risk.

7. FINAL NOTES
────────────────────────────
